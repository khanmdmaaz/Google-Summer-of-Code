# GSOC
Google Summer of Code is a mentorship program that brings programmers like you together with great mentors and awesome projects. 
-*__More than 10,000 students__* participate in it.
-It helds across *__108 countries__*. 
-It's been running *__since 2005__*.
-It has *__more than 33,000,000__* lines of code.


## Concept
--------------

The focus of the programmme is on bringing more student develepors into open source software development. Students get to work for open source organisations on a 3 month programming project during the breaks from school.

You can look up for the technologies that the organisations require and comfortably select your environment.

## How Does It Work
Participating students are brought under mentors from different participating organisations, so that students can have exposure to the real world software development and techniques.
In turn, participating organisations are able to identifdy and bring in develepors who can keep on participating in the developmentand even after the program gets over.

#### Students:
They can select an organisation to work with, and contact with the mentors and write up a project proposal. Iff it's selcted they get 3 month to code, meeting the deadlines agreed up on with their mentors.

#### Mentors:
The existing contributors with the organisations choose to mentor a student project. Mentors work along with students to reach their definite goal.

#### Organisations:
They provide mentors to guide the students through the program. They also discuss their idea with the students.
